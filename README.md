# mysqltest

I had to deal with a existing database and that was mysql. So to to access that mysql database, I had to do http request, response like we do with android to talk to mysql db. Usually we use php to fetch data from db and that end point we can use in our flutter app. This is a simple crud app that I have used to test.

In the flutter root directory you can find a directory called `php_files` and inside that directory has `fluttertest` directory. Copy that one and paste it into your xampp/htdocs(or any local server you have or even to your running cloud server).

Now you can change content as you want and don't forget to change `conn.php` file db configuration for your db.

There is `mysql_backup` directory also, if you want, you can import and check or create and use your own.

Regards!
